            Work-life balance has effectively been thrown out of the window
            because there’s just not a whole lot of life going on outside of
            work. There’s only so many Zoom pub quizzes and socially distanced
            walks you can do before it too becomes part of the overwhelming
            sadness of lockdown. I’ve found myself clinging onto work like a
            raft that can protect me from my greatest fear at the moment:
            boredom. When I don’t have things to be doing for my degree, I find
            myself desperately hunting for summer internships (the end of term
            is looming worryingly near and with it a vast sea of nothingness),
            or writing articles.

            The thought of having to sit alone with no kind of distraction from
            the ongoing situation frankly terrifies me. I’ve found myself
            clinging onto work like a raft that can protect me from my greatest
            fear at the moment of boredom.

            In some ways, this situation is a great insight into what life would
            be like if everything was more heavily digitalised. Our social lives
            are now almost exclusively online, as well as our leisure and
            learning time. Besides the fun side effect of eye strain
            (surprisingly painful?), I’ve noticed that it’s become a lot more
            difficult to justify time spent away from screens when there’s so
            little to do away from screens. For years, the overwhelming rhetoric
            in the media has been one of condemning our generation’s technology
            usage, and yet here we are, in a world where this is not only normal
            but also the only safe way of continuing onwards. And apart from
            these 9 to 5 online classes we are assigned to do loads and loads of
            project works which makes us to spend extra mile hours on systems or
            in front of screens, meanwhile some parents be like your always
            online or on phone come and help in households Alas, literally what
            a situation we are in? its really so hard managing everything. Thus,
            to its really hard to concentrate on this virtual classes being at
            home.

            I’ve noticed that it’s become a lot more difficult to justify time
            spent away from screens when there’s so little to do away from
            screens. Like almost every one from kids to elders to old age people
            everyone relies on screens for entertainment or working to escape
            from this present pandemic lockdown boredom. Life online doesn’t
            seem to have quite the same texture to it as the real world. I study
            a research-oriented subject, and a lot of my contact hours are made
            up of discussion-based or practical mode of learning, but it just
            doesn’t seem to function in the same way in an online setting. The
            physical space of the classroom becomes flattened, so that if two
            people talk at the same time it becomes difficult to discern what
            either is saying. This has led to such a high level of turn-taking
            in conversation that debate loses its engaging quality, and I come
            away from classes feeling intellectually quite blank.

            When it comes to the people working from home, I think due to this
            pandemic most of the people work from home sitting for prolonged
            hours Infront, of computers or laptops and as there are no workers
            or maids available all the chores are to be done ourselves , I feel
            its really stressful to handle both the household chores and office
            work deadlines which literally terrifies and mentally kills up the
            individual.

            The same happens when you try to recreate group settings, like in
            Zoom calls with your friends. In ordinary life, it is normal for
            there to be several ongoing discussions at once. When everyone’s
            talking at the same volume, you’re forced into a scenario where the
            entire group is often listening to one person at a time, which makes
            everything you say just feel like it has a bit more pressure on it.
            It really so sad of not being able to hang out with our friends or
            meet them up.

            That my biggest problems right now are boredom and loneliness is an
            exceptionally privileged position to be in. There are people in
            unbearable living situations, or people that have become ill, or
            lost family and friends. Being bored is really quiet a lucky state
            of being.
