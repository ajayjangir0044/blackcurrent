            From living like a free bird in the remote world to living like a
            bird in cage, our lives had experienced an unexpected twist and
            turns which no one could ever dream of, this pandemic had become a
            nightmare for everyone. Still mid-march everything seemed normal and
            calm. Then came a curve of pandemic due to this corona virus which
            made the world upside down. It was unexpected on 20th march our
            college announced 15 days holidays due to this pandemic, and we were
            all in cloud nine in the thought of going home so we did pack our
            bags and returned home with strange journey then before as it was
            covid times, taking certain precautions such as using face masks,
            social distancing and sanitisers so on. Then started this worldwide
            lockdown starting from May 25th and still going on it had been six
            months of being captured between the four walls of my room. These
            was for the first time we heard different words like quarantine,
            SARS…. etc. It was never expected longest vacation one could ever
            have. Life in lockdown is changing what we do and how we feel. This
            could be our reality for a while and it’s important that we begin to
            adapt and accept our new way of life.
          </p>

        <div>
          <p class="p1">
            Under lockdown circumstances, one cannot go out to work or can go
            out to malls or cinemas for leisure activities. A lockdown means
            that people need to stay inside and safe. Essential service like
            groceries, medications, banks are only allowed to function in this
            crucial time. Millions of children across the world are facing life
            in lockdown. This can be a difficult time. Away from friends, away
            from school, away from education, this generation is missing out on
            everyday activities we used to take for granted.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="p1">
            Although we go out for necessities there was a haunting fear in
            minds of people as this corona virus being a contagious disease
            which spreads through air. Due to this sudden lockdown many people
            stayed up at home and had quality time together with their families,
            where as some people could not reach their families and had to stay
            away till this lockdown ends. There was great loss to the country
            economically due to cessation of all the activities. Mainly the
            daily wage workers who migrated to cities or different states
            leaving their villages suffered a lot due to no income and
            livelihood, some literally walked back to their home towns as there
            was no transportation. The homeless people and the shelter less
            animals were most effected, died in hunger as due to evoking fear of
            this pandemic and the strict lockdown no body was willing to give
            some water or food for them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="p1">
            And nearly huge number of people lost their jobs and some were not
            paid or paid less then what they get regularly. Mainly the health
            workers, police officers were the only warriors worked risking their
            lives to save people lives or help the effected on, so many of them
            distanced themselves their families to not infect them few of them
            were biased by neighbourhood people or house owners and some of them
            lost their lives in order to save others. The graph of our country
            raised exponentially reaching lakhs of lakhs of corona cases which
            lead to lack of health facilities or beds in hospital and made the
            condition vulnerable. The only hope for the people was the discovery
            of the outbreak for this virus by discovery of vaccine. Scientists
            have been working on it but it had been a long wait so people are
            tired on it and started adjusting with these new conditions we are
            within. I think the only positive thing happened in this lockdown is
            that the mother earth is being healing due to no pollution due to
            transportation and cessation of all the activities, that’s why we
            had a plentiful rainfall rate this year and the animals and birds
            were having a lively environment to live, in some areas we could see
            peacocks coming on to roads.
          </p>

        <div>
          <p class="p1">
            And the main cause is mental health is being affected due to the
            economic crisis, stress, and more exposure to blue light or screen
            is also harmful as we can see from small kids, children, adults
            everyone are dependent on these for entertainment, education (online
            classes), or jobs (due to work from home) which may literally affect
            our health and well-being. I wish we could get out this virtual
            world to our past olden days as soon as possible into the real
            world.
