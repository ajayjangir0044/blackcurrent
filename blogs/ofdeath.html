            Death and ghosts have one thing in common, people are curious about
            them and often discussion of one leads to another, real bad deaths
            are not one which is gruesome but those which have a sense of fun
            element associated with them, like an ox coming from behind shove
            his horn in your buttocks and throw you away causing death, though
            your nearest kin may feel only one emotion and that is of sorrow,
            same can't be said about others, and if you have done mediocre sins
            so that you are denied entry into heaven and also rejected by hell
            and left to wander like a ghost you can see this bizarre funny-sad
            moment where whom you considered all your life as Nobel soul maybe
            will be whispering about your death to someone else while having an
            unexplainable release of endorphins from their body, and the funny
            part is maybe you do not feel that bad about them laughing at your
            death standing just behind your graveyard, well that's only possible
            if one believe in existence of ghosts like that of a society where
            communism is accepted with heart and mind.

            If death and birth are considered to be a cycle, and you are having
            a hard time dealing with your present life then why not to die, who
            knows you take birth to the royal family of Britain or end up being
            a son of an owner of a strip club, though the probability of both
            cases is pretty low and depends on the family planning of respective
            responsible people then again you have 'n' chances which are quite
            alot to adopt trial and error method if the sky is the limit for
            'n', if one goes to hell or heaven depending on one's deeds and the
            number of times it takes gods name, and it is assummed that death
            and sins both can be quantified then why not to die sooner, it will
            decrease the possibility of one doing sins or you can calculate your
            sins and take god name that many times before your predecided
            doomsday so as to certain your ticket to heaven with a condition
            that you do not procastinate, maybe you can avail early reaching
            benefit if heaven has the policy of first cum first serve one of
            them being you can have more then 72 hoors for you.

            For a person from neutral reference frame death is a normal and
            often happening event, one who says dead people should not be
            inculpated or criticized are either ignorant or foolish or
            hypocrites because history judges everything, even nature and way of
            death and historians who are hell-bound committed to some ideology
            are like maulvis in a devotee Muslim society who are Arabic
            illiterate, sometimes the righteousness and truthfulness of event do
            not matter, what matter is acceptance of certain individuals as
            intellectuals by the society who can create another perception of
            death which suits them and their interests.

            the banks of a flooding river or while you are experiencing ultimate
            societal taboo bliss and your heart fail due to excess of sildenafil
